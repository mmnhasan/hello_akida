### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mmnhasan/hello-_akida/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

##Markdown:
A First Level Header
====================

A Second Level Header
---------------------

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

### Header 3

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.


##Markdown:

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.


##LIST
*   Candy.
*   Gum.
*   Booz
+   Candy.
+   Gum.
+   Booze.
-   Candy.
-   Gum.


##Ordered (numbered)
1.  Red
2.  Green
3.  Blue


##multi-paragraph

*   A list item.

    With multiple paragraphs.

*   Another item in the list.


##LINKS
This is an [example link](http://example.com/).
> include a title 
 




-   Booze.



##include a title
This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").



##Reference-style links 
[1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"



##The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters, numbers and spaces, but are not case sensitive:
I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
[The New York Times][NY Times].

[ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/



##IMAGES

Image syntax is very much like link syntax.

Inline (titles are optional):

![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title")
Reference-style:

![alt text][id]

[id]: /path/to/img.jpg "Title"
Both of the above examples produce the same output:

<img src="/path/to/img.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Title" />



##CODE
I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.


##Markdown:

    <blockquote>
        <p>For example.</p>
    </blockquote>
